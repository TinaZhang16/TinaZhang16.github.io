  <p>“Debate is not about getting answers, it’s about keeping the pursuit going.” I like the fun of thinking, the fun of checking information and writing a manuscript as a team, and the fun of concentrating on asking questions in the debate. The meaning of the debate itself is definitely greater than the result of winning or losing. Debating not only makes my thinking more agile, but also makes me look at problems more rationally.</p>

  <p>I love hosting and reciting. I like speaking out in front of the public and conveying my voice to everyone. But due to the ever-increasing workload of study, I haven’t participated in similar activities for a long time.</p>

  <p>I like photography, it allows me to discover and record beauty, and it gives me unlimited room for imagination. The picture above is of my alma mater, China University of Mining and Technology, where there are seas of flowers, black swans, and mountains... I will always love my alma mater. But my photography skills still have a lot of room for improvement.</p>
