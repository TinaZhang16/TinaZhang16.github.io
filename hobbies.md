  <p>“Debate is not about getting answers, it’s about keeping the pursuit going.” I like the fun of thinking, the fun of checking information and writing a manuscript as a team, and the fun of concentrating on asking questions in the debate. The meaning of the debate itself is definitely greater than the result of winning or losing. Debating not only makes my thinking more agile, but also makes me look at problems more rationally.</p>

  <p>I love hosting and reciting. I like speaking out in front of the public and conveying my voice to everyone. But due to the ever-increasing workload of study, I haven’t participated in similar activities for a long time.</p>

  <p>I think volleyball is a sport that not only challenges me physically but also fosters teamwork and communication. Whether I'm on the court practicing serves or working with my teammates to execute strategic plays, volleyball teaches me discipline, persistence, and the importance of collaboration. Volleyball has become more than just a hobby for me—it’s a way to build friendships, learn valuable life lessons, and stay active.</p>
